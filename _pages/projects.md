localhost reinvented lodging with auction. Search, bid and stay in
accommodation in one site. Implemented with Django, Django Channels, Celery,
and more. Deployed on AWS.

## [implant](https://github.com/lamcw/implant)
The sc-implant project consists of a loadable Linux kernel module and a companion toolchain, internally referred to as sc-client, for managing the module. The objective of this project is to provide an easy-to-use implant to be used as a home base for further operations when red-teaming and conducting penetration tests.

project when I was a research assistant at UNSW.
